// Takes the REPL output and views it. Mostly, this is just displaying it as a string, but some special forms (like
// vega graphics specs) receive special treatment.
//
// Note that this is very primitive at the moment, there is very little 'understanding' on the javascript side of what
// the output is - we convert it in to a js structure, but don't do much with it. Much more would be possible if we were
// to parse the output and generate output from the parse tree (think lists of graphics for instance). But that can come
// later.
